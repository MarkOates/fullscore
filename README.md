# Fullscore

Fullscore is music composition software with 2 design priorities:

1. Let the composer focus on the processes and techniques of modern music composition, theoretical concepts, structures, patterns, transformations, sets, cells, etc.
2. Allow music to be edited and transformed as quickly and robustly as possible, either at the low-level or the high-level, regardless of the required learning curve.

### How to get

There are no binary releases yet so you will have to build from source.

### Build Instructions

Fullscore is written in C++ and requires AllegroFlare.  If you're building with `gcc` or `clang`
you should be able to compile Fullscore from the bash terminal by grabbing the
source from the git repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MarkOates/fullscore.git
```

and then building with make:

```
$ make
```
