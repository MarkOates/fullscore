Fullscore is music composition software with 2 design priorities:

1. Let the composer focus on the processes and techniques of modern music composition, theoretical concepts, structures, patterns, transformations, sets, cells, etc.
2. Allow music to be edited and transformed as quickly and robustly as possible, either at the low-level or the high-level, regardless of the required learning curve.
