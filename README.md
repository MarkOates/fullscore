# Fullscore

Fullscore is music composition software with 2 design priorities:

1. Let the composer focus on the higher-level compositional processes of modern music composition rather than note-by-note notation.
2. Integrate tools into the compositional process that allow the composer to navigate and chain together theoretical concepts, structures, patterns, transformations, sets, cells, etc.
3. Allow music to be edited and transformed as quickly and robustly as possible, either at the low-level or the high-level, regardless of the required learning curve.
