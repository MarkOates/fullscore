# Fullscore

Music composition software in C++ using AllegroFlare+FlareGUI

# features

Fullscore is software that lets the composer focus on the processes and techniques of modern music composition, rather tan fiddle with clumsy music notation.  Composers interface with theoretical concepts, and build compositions using structures, patterns, transformations, sets, cells, and more.
